# Chowster

Chowster is a social media for food truckers, essentially Twitter for food trucks!  I got the idea of building this application from an episode of Bob's Burgers. Chowster is a learning project and is my first Full Stack application.

Core concepts I wanted for the user on initial release:
- Create an account.
- Login/Logout if authenticated;
- View and edit your details if authenticated.
- Create a post (I call them a 'chowt' like 'shout' because I'm hilarious) if authenticated.
- View other users accounts and recent posts.
- Like posts if authenticated.
- Delete your post if authenticated.
- Only food trucks accounts can post location.
- Delete your account.
- Update your account details.
- Rate a food truck.
- Display total number of likes for a post.

Be sure to check out the [issues](https://github.com/aaronmassey45/Node-React-Project/issues) page to view some things I still want to do!
