# Chowster

Chowster is a social media for food truckers! I got the idea of building this application from an episode of Bob's Burgers. Chowster is a learning project and is my first attempt as a Full Stack application.

Things you can currently do:
- Create an account.
- Login/Logout if authenticated;
- View and edit your details if authenticated.
- Create a post (I call them a 'chowt' like 'shout' because I'm hilarious) if authenticated.
- View other users accounts and recent posts.
- Like posts if authenticated.
- Delete your post if authenticated.

Some ideas to be implemented:
- Rate a food truck.
- Post your location if food truck account.
- Display total number of likes for a post.
- Post can only be liked once by an user.
- Delete your account.
- Update your account details.
